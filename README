This is a lightweight interface to Kannel (available via your local apt-get
repository) to make sending and receiving SMS messages in Python a little
more friendly, at the cost of a little abstraction. It's very bare right
now; you may consider that an invitation for pataches.


Usage (from kannel.py):

class TestReceiver():
    def iGotAnSMS(self, caller, msg):
        print "SMS from %s: %s" % (caller, msg)

    tr = TestReceiver()
    print "Waiting for SMS..."
    SmsReceiver(tr.iGotAnSMS).run()
